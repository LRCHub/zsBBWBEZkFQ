[00:09.74] I'm gonna make a change
[00:12.75] For once in my life
[00:18.14] It's gonna feel real good
[00:20.80] Gonna make a difference
[00:22.86] Gonna make it right
[00:32.36] 
[00:27.87] As I, turn up the collar on
[00:31.81] My favorite winter coat
[00:34.08] This wind is blowin' my mind
[00:37.85] I see the kids in the street
[00:40.51] With not enough to eat
[00:42.23] Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?
[01:10.23] 
[00:48.41] A summer's disregard
[00:50.87] A broken bottle top
[00:53.59] And a one man's soul
[00:57.39] They follow each other on the wind ya know
[01:01.69] 'Cause they got nowhere to go
[01:04.92] That's why I want you to know
[01:19.42] 
[01:07.63] I'm starting with the man in the mirror
[01:12.78] I'm asking him to change his ways
[01:16.85] And no message could've been any clearer
[01:21.24] If they wanna make the world a better place
[01:23.60] Take a look at yourself and then make a change
[01:46.60] 
[01:36.49] I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
[01:41.02] It's time that I realize
[01:44.58] That there are some with no home
[01:47.45] Not a nickel to loan
[01:49.32] Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
[02:17.32] 
[01:55.01] A willow deeply scarred
[01:57.72] Somebody's broken heart
[02:00.19] And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
[02:04.47] They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
[02:08.85] 'Cause they got no place to be
[02:12.14] That's why I'm starting with me
[02:27.64] 
[02:14.51] I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)

[03:33.98] 
[03:11.44] (You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
[03:13.59] ('Cause when you close your heart) you can't
[03:15.02] (Then you close your) close your, your mind
